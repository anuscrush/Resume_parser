Welcome to the Resume Parser project! This repository contains code and resources for building an AI-powered resume parser. The goal of this project is to automatically extract relevant information from resumes or CVs, such as contact details, work experience, education, skills, and other relevant sections, and convert it into a structured format.

## Dataset Overview
